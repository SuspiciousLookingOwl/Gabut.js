## Creating New Command

I provided a script to easily create a new command file. You can run:

```
npm run create-command -- command-name "Command Description"
```
to easily create a new command file template inside [src/commands](src/commands) folder.

Then you can edit the copied `index.ts` inside `src/commands/command-name` folder.

The template also includes `.spec.ts` file to get you started with unit testing your command.
